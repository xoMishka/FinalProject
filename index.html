            <h2>About the Author</h2>

            <p>English writer, scholar and philologist, Tolkien's father was a bank 
                manager in South Africa. Shortly before his father died (1896) his 
                mother took him and his younger brother to his father's native village 
                of Sarehole, near Birmingham, England. The landscapes and Nordic mythology 
                of the Midlands may have been the source for Tolkien's fertile imagination 
                to write about 'the Shire' and 'hobbits' in his later book the Hobbit (1937).
                After his mother's death in 1904 he was looked after by Father Francis Xavier
                Morgan a RC priest of the Congregation of the Oratory. Tolkien was educated 
                at King Edward VI school in Birmingham. He studied linguistics at Exeter 
                College, Oxford, and took his B.A. in 1915. In 1916 he fought in World War
                I with the Lancashire Fusiliers. It is believed that his experiences during 
                The Battle of the Somne may have been fueled the darker side of his 
                subsequent novels. Upon his return he worked as an assistant on the Oxford 
                English Dictionary (1918-20) and took his M.A. in 1919. In 1920 he became a 
                teacher in English at the University of Leeds. He then went on to Merton 
                College in Oxford, where he became Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of 
                Anglo-Saxon (1925-45) and Merton professor of English Language and Literature
                (1945-59). His first scholarly publication was an edition of Sir Gawain and
                the Green Knight (1925). He also wrote books on Chaucer (1934) and Beowulf 
                (1937). In 1939 Tolkien gave the Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St.
                Andrews in Scotland titled: "On Fairy-Stories". Tolkien will however be 
                remembered most for his books the Hobbit (1937) and the Lord of the Rings 
                (1954-55). The Hobbit began as a bedtime story for his children". 
                He wrote Lord of the Rings over a period of about 14 years.</p>

            <p>Tolkien also discussed parts of his novels with fellow Oxfordian and 
                fantasy writer CS Lewis during their 'meetings'. He was trying to 
                create a fantasy world so that he could explain how he had invented 
                certain languages, and in doing so created 'Middle-earth'. However 
                among his peers at Oxford his works were not well received as they 
                were not considered 'scholarly'. It was after LOTR was published in 
                paperback in the United States in 1965 that he developed his legendary
                cult following and also imitators. Tolkien was W. P. Ker lecturer at 
                Glasgow University in 1953. In 1954 both the University of Liege and 
                University College, Dublin, awarded him honorary doctorates. He 
                received the CBE in 1972. He served as vice-president of the 
                Philological Society and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of 
                Literature. He was made an honorary fellow of Exeter College. Despite 
                the immense popularity of his books today Tolkien did not greatly 
                benefit from their sales. His son Christopher Tolkien was able to 
                publish some of his works posthumously after his manuscripts were 
                found.</p>

                    <p>Viggo Mortensen broke his toe filming this scene. Peter Jackson 
                        wanted him to kick the helmet close to the camera, but he kept 
                        missing. In the final shot he kicked a real metal helmet 
                        instead of the prop one and fell over screaming. Peter Jackson 
                        was like Wow, Viggo really got into that one but he’d actually 
                        broken his toe. The shot was so good they kept it in the movie. 
                        We just watched Viggo Mortensen break his toe for real. </p>
