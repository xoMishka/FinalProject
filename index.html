            <h2>About the Author</h2>

            <p>English writer, scholar and philologist, Tolkien's father was a bank 
                manager in South Africa. Shortly before his father died (1896) his 
                mother took him and his younger brother to his father's native village 
                of Sarehole, near Birmingham, England. The landscapes and Nordic mythology 
                of the Midlands may have been the source for Tolkien's fertile imagination 
                to write about 'the Shire' and 'hobbits' in his later book the Hobbit (1937).
                After his mother's death in 1904 he was looked after by Father Francis Xavier
                Morgan a RC priest of the Congregation of the Oratory. Tolkien was educated 
                at King Edward VI school in Birmingham. He studied linguistics at Exeter 
                College, Oxford, and took his B.A. in 1915. In 1916 he fought in World War
                I with the Lancashire Fusiliers. It is believed that his experiences during 
                The Battle of the Somne may have been fueled the darker side of his 
                subsequent novels. Upon his return he worked as an assistant on the Oxford 
                English Dictionary (1918-20) and took his M.A. in 1919. In 1920 he became a 
                teacher in English at the University of Leeds. He then went on to Merton 
                College in Oxford, where he became Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of 
                Anglo-Saxon (1925-45) and Merton professor of English Language and Literature
                (1945-59). His first scholarly publication was an edition of Sir Gawain and
                the Green Knight (1925). He also wrote books on Chaucer (1934) and Beowulf 
                (1937). In 1939 Tolkien gave the Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St.
                Andrews in Scotland titled: "On Fairy-Stories". Tolkien will however be 
                remembered most for his books the Hobbit (1937) and the Lord of the Rings 
                (1954-55). The Hobbit began as a bedtime story for his children". 
                He wrote Lord of the Rings over a period of about 14 years.</p>

            <p>Tolkien also discussed parts of his novels with fellow Oxfordian and 
                fantasy writer CS Lewis during their 'meetings'. He was trying to 
                create a fantasy world so that he could explain how he had invented 
                certain languages, and in doing so created 'Middle-earth'. However 
                among his peers at Oxford his works were not well received as they 
                were not considered 'scholarly'. It was after LOTR was published in 
                paperback in the United States in 1965 that he developed his legendary
                cult following and also imitators. Tolkien was W. P. Ker lecturer at 
                Glasgow University in 1953. In 1954 both the University of Liege and 
                University College, Dublin, awarded him honorary doctorates. He 
                received the CBE in 1972. He served as vice-president of the 
                Philological Society and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of 
                Literature. He was made an honorary fellow of Exeter College. Despite 
                the immense popularity of his books today Tolkien did not greatly 
                benefit from their sales. His son Christopher Tolkien was able to 
                publish some of his works posthumously after his manuscripts were 
                found.</p>

                    <p>The cast often had to fly to remote shoot locations by helicopter. 
                        Sean Bean (Boromir) was afraid of flying and would only do it when absolutely 
                        necessary. When they were shooting the scenes of the Fellowship crossing the 
                        snowy mountains he'd spend two hours every morning climbing from the base of 
                        the mountain to the set near the top, already dressed as Boromir. The crew 
                        being flown up could see him from their helicopters.</p>

                    <p>After kicking a helmet, Mortensen immediately shattered one of his 
                        toes — and ultimately, the take in which he broke his toe ended up in 
                        the final cut of the trilogy's second film, The Two Towers. Mortensen 
                        was no stranger to injuries, but at least this one was invisible to 
                        audiences. During filming for The Fellowship of the Ring, co-stars Billy 
                        Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, who play hobbits Merry and Pippin, respectively,
                        took Mortensen surfing, resulting in a black eye and forcing him to be shot
                        in profile for weeks. He also chipped a tooth during The Two Towers, asking
                        if he could simply glue his tooth back on until Jackson made his star go to 
                        the hospital.</p>

                    <p>Sir Christopher Lee (Saruman) read "The Lord of the Rings" once a year
                         until his death in 2015, and had done so since the year it was 
                         published. He was also the only member of the cast and crew ever 
                         to have met J.R.R. Tolkien. He was also the first person to be cast in 
                         the trilogy, because of his extensive knowledge of the books. He frequently
                         visited the make-up department, and often gave tips about the facial design 
                         of the monsters.  </p>

                        scene sixteen times to get it just right, and Billy Boyd says he believes 
                        Mortensen enjoyed himself immensely.</p>

                    <p>For high-tech tasks, a computer program called MASSIVE made armies of CGI

                        independently, identifying friend or foe, thanks to individual fields of 
                        vision. Director Peter Jackson's team could click on one creature, in a 
                        crowd scene of twenty thousand, and see through his "eyes". Different species
                        even boast unique fighting styles. </p>

                        reviewing his training sessions with the sword and being spotted by members 
                        of the public. </p>
